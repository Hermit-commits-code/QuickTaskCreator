## Assigning Tasks to Users

- When a user is @mentioned in the `/task` or `/task-edit` command, their Slack user ID is parsed and stored in the `assigned_user` field in the database.
- The app displays the assigned user in the task message (e.g., `Assigned to: @hermit`).
- Future: Add interactive assignment via buttons or dropdowns.
